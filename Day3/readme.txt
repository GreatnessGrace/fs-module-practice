// About this repo : -
 This repo is all about the file module in nodejs : 
We have implemented file module in all the three way i.e. Asynchronous , Synchronous and for the promise based api

Do not confuse by a lot of empty files and folders as they are just the result of the some methods implementations of the fs module 


The useful files are :- 
1) promise_api.js  
2) callback_api.js
3) Sync.js (not too much code as they are similar to the other two methods only a sync keyword is added in the front of every method)


For smooth running just comment out single-single method in these files and run them and you will see fs module in action .
